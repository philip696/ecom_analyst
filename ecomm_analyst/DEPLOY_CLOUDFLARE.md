# Deploy to Cloudflare (Pages + Worker)

Cloudflare **Pages** hosts the **static Next.js** export. The **Cloudflare Worker** (`cloudflare-worker/src/gateway.js`) serves **`/images/*`** from **R2** and **proxies** everything else to **`API_UPSTREAM`** (your **FastAPI** HTTPS origin—set in the Worker dashboard or Wrangler; not committed by default). Details: [`cloudflare-worker/README.md`](cloudflare-worker/README.md).

## GitHub Actions (optional)

A workflow in `.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yml` runs on pushes to `main` that touch `frontend/`. Add repository **variables** and **secrets**:

- **Variable** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` — use **`https://ecom-analyst.philip-dewanto.workers.dev`** (no trailing slash) so GHA builds match production; `frontend/deploy-urls.js` is the fallback when unset locally.
- **Secrets** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (see [Direct Upload / CI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/use-direct-upload-with-continuous-integration/)).
- The deploy command uses `--project-name=ecomm-analyst-frontend`; create that Pages project in Cloudflare or change the name in the workflow.

## 1. Frontend — Cloudflare Pages

The app is built as a static export (`next.config.js` → `output: "export"`). The `out/` directory is the deployable site.

### Environment variables (Pages)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Yes | HTTPS origin of the **Worker** API: **`https://ecom-analyst.philip-dewanto.workers.dev`** — **no trailing slash**. Baked in at **build** time; rebuild Pages after changing it. (Defaults also come from `frontend/deploy-urls.js`.) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_USE_PROXY` | No | Defaults to proxy mode. Set to `0` to call the Worker origin directly from the browser (then CORS on the Worker must allow your Pages origin). |

Set these under **Pages project → Settings → Variables and Secrets → + Add** for **Production** (and **Preview** if you use preview deployments). Use the **same** name exactly: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

**Same-origin API (default):** when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is a non-local `https://` URL, `next build` writes `public/_redirects` so Cloudflare Pages **proxies** `/api/*` and `/images/*` to that Worker. The static bundle uses a **relative** API base, so the browser only talks to your `*.pages.dev` origin (no cross-origin preflight to the Worker). Rebuild Pages after changing the Worker URL.

If the build log says **“Build environment variables: (none found)”**, that line only describes **`[vars]` inside `wrangler.toml`** — it does **not** mean your dashboard vars are missing. As long as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set on the **Pages** project, `next build` will see it.

`next.config.js` prints a **warning** (not a hard error) if `CF_PAGES=1` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is still empty, so you can fix the dashboard and redeploy without changing code.

**Worker / API CORS:** set **`FRONTEND_URL`** to your **Pages** site origin (e.g. `https://your-app.pages.dev`). Optional **`ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS`** (comma-separated) if you need several origins (e.g. preview + production). Set in **`cloudflare-worker/wrangler.jsonc`** `vars` and/or Wrangler **secrets**, then redeploy the Worker.

### Build settings (dashboard)

For this repository, the Next app and `package-lock.json` live under **`ecomm_analyst/frontend`** (not the repo root).

- **Root directory:** `ecomm_analyst/frontend` (required here; use `frontend` only if your clone has no `ecomm_analyst/` wrapper)
- **Build command:** `npm ci && npm run build` (needs `package-lock.json` in the root directory above — if you omit the path, `npm ci` fails)
- **Build output directory:** `out`

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Browser calls `http://localhost:8000` from `*.pages.dev` / CORS errors | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was missing at **build** time, so the bundle fell back to localhost. Set it on the Pages project and **redeploy** (rebuild). With a valid `https://` Worker URL, the app also emits `_redirects` for same-origin `/api` and `/images`. |
| `npm ci` … no `package-lock.json` | Set **Root directory** to `ecomm_analyst/frontend`, or use `npm install && npm run build` (less reproducible than `npm ci`). |
| Clone: `should have been pointers` for `ecommerce.db` | `.gitattributes` must not mark `*.db` as Git LFS unless every `.db` is actually stored as an LFS pointer. This repo keeps the demo DB as a normal Git file. |

### CLI deploy (optional)

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.production.example .env.production   # and edit NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, or set in dashboard only
npm run build
npx --yes wrangler@3 pages deploy out --project-name=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

`wrangler.toml` in `frontend/` documents the `out` output path.

## 2. Backend

### Cloudflare Pages cannot host this FastAPI app

**Pages** only serves **static files** from your Next export (`out/`). It does **not** run Python, Uvicorn, or long‑lived API processes. **Pages Functions** are lightweight **Workers** colocated with the site; they are **not** a drop‑in host for this whole **`backend/`** FastAPI codebase.

To keep **everything under Cloudflare** (while Pages stays frontend‑only), use one of these **separate** products for compute:

| Product | What it is | Fit for this repo |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **[Cloudflare Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/)** | Run a **Docker** image on Cloudflare; a **Worker** routes traffic to the container. | Closest to “host the **`backend/Dockerfile`** on Cloudflare”. You get an HTTPS origin to set as **`API_UPSTREAM`**. Check Cloudflare’s current **beta / pricing / limits** and cold‑start behavior. |
| **[Python Workers — FastAPI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/fastapi/)** | ASGI FastAPI on the **Workers** runtime (**Pyodide** / managed Python). | Possible for **small** APIs; **package / binary / size / CPU** limits differ from normal Linux. This repo **previously** moved the edge gateway to **JavaScript** because Workers Python was a poor fit for the full stack—treat as experimental unless you trim dependencies heavily. |

Example community template: [fastapi-on-cloudflare-containers](https://github.com/abyesilyurt/fastapi-on-cloudflare-containers).

### Option A — Container (recommended for production)

Run FastAPI in a **container** or PaaS, for example:

- **Railway, Render, Google Cloud Run**, a VM, or any HTTPS host you control—then point the Worker’s **`API_UPSTREAM`** at that base URL.

A sample **`backend/Dockerfile`** is provided. Set environment variables in that platform, for example:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Your Cloudflare Pages site, e.g. `https://your-app.pages.dev` (used for CORS) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Production: use PostgreSQL, e.g. `postgresql+psycopg2://...` (see `backend/database.py`) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Strong random string for JWT |
| `LLM_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | If using AI Insights (Deepseek by default) |

For product images, include **`data200/image/`** in the image or mount a volume; CSV seed data is under `data_200/`.

### Option B — Cloudflare Worker + R2 (JavaScript gateway)

Deploy from **`cloudflare-worker/`**: **`src/gateway.js`** serves **`/images/*`** from **R2** and **proxies** all other paths to **`API_UPSTREAM`** (your FastAPI base URL). Use **`bash ecomm_analyst/deploy-cloudflare-worker.sh`** (`npm ci` + **`npx wrangler deploy`**). See **`cloudflare-worker/README.md`** for bucket creation, `sync-r2-images.sh`, and vars.

**If the Worker returns 503** *Worker misconfigured … API_UPSTREAM* **:** the deployed Worker has no upstream. Set it once:

```bash
cd ecomm_analyst/cloudflare-worker && npx wrangler secret put API_UPSTREAM
```

Use your FastAPI **HTTPS** base URL only (no path, no trailing slash), e.g. `https://your-api.onrender.com`. Or add **`API_UPSTREAM`** under **Workers & Pages → ecom-analyst → Settings → Variables and secrets**. Full steps: [`cloudflare-worker/README.md`](cloudflare-worker/README.md#api_upstream-missing-503).

## 3. CORS

The API already allows origins from `app/main.py` (see `CORSMiddleware` and `settings.FRONTEND_URL`). Set **`FRONTEND_URL`** to the exact **Pages URL** (including `https://`).

## 4. Checklist

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Cloudflare Pages  
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` and `DATABASE_URL` (and `SECRET_KEY`) on the API host  
- [ ] API publicly reachable with HTTPS (Mixed Content if the page is `https://`)  
- [ ] Re-seed or migrate DB in production as needed
